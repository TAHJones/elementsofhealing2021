            <p>Homeopathy is a natural system of medicine that was discovered two hundred years ago by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. It is based upon healing principles that have existed for thousands of years. The word homeopathy means ‘similar suffering’ and originates from the Greek words "homos" (similar) and "pathos" (disease, suffering). Its central principle is The Law of Similars which states that the symptoms of disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in a healthy individual. Homeopaths refer to this healing principle as ‘like cures like’.</p>

            <p><span id="responsiveCardsParagraph">The examples of The Law of Similars above are highly simplistic</span>. Treating chronic illness requires the similarity of the remedy to go beyond the symptoms of disease. Homeopathy does not just treat the symptoms of disease, it treats the whole person. An understanding of the relationship between a person’s symptoms and their personality is essential in order to make a successful prescription. Therefore homeopathy treats each person individually based on their particular symptom picture. This includes their reactions to illnesses, their personality, lifestyle, medical history and much more. Gradually a pattern emerges from this information which can be matched to a homeopathic remedy.</p>

            <p>Finding a remedy that matches the clients individual state is an in-depth process. It requires high levels of observation, a good understanding of the clients case and a broad knowledge of the animal, plant and mineral kingdoms from which the remedies are made. One has to understand that holistic healing is an unfolding process rather than a one off diagnosis and cure. The client usually requires a certain amount of time for their healing process to naturally unfold. They may also require several different remedies during this time to support them as issues arise to be healed and released.</p>
